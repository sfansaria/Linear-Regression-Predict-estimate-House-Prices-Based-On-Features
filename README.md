# Linear-Regression-Predict-estimate-House-Prices-Based-On-Features

The challenge: You have been provided a data set made up of housing features and their
target price. The data set contains 1460 observations and 26 features. Use the
CW_1_Appendix document to understand the dataset provided to you. Your task is to
develop a machine learning model to predict/estimate house prices based on their features.

The aim of this coursework is to design, implement and evaluate an
effective machine learning pipeline for predicting house prices. The specific tasks and
corresponding mark scheme are given in the table below. It is up to you how you approach
this problem, design a solution and write-up your results. For each task, the mark within the
grade boundary will be based on your description in your report, results and code.
